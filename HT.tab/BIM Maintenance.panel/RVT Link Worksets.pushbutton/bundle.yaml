    This tool creates a Workset for each Revit Linked file in accordance with the HTL naming standard. It asks a user to include HTL originator code or not. It also moves existing links to corresponding Worksets if a link type or instance element is not placed correctly. 
            
    User will be asked at the end of the process if worksets with no RVT link replaced by a Workset with an updated name should be deleted. This unfortunately due to Revit API limitations can only be done to Editable Worksets.
